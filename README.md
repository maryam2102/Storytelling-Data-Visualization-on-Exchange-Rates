# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates
This project analyzes the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate data spanning from 1999 to 2023. It begins by cleaning and preparing the dataset, focusing on visualizing the exchange rate trends over time. Through the use of moving averages, the project highlights how to smooth out daily fluctuations to reveal longer-term trends in the exchange rate.

The visualizations depict various significant periods, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. By applying rolling means, the project effectively showcases how the exchange rate behaved during these challenging times, offering insights into economic fluctuations and trends.

Additionally, the project compares the exchange rate trends during the presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Through side-by-side visualizations, it illustrates how the exchange rate evolved under each administration, providing a comprehensive overview of the currency's performance during pivotal political periods.
